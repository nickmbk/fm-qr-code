## Overview

A challenge set at the beginning of Frontend Mentor to create a QR Code Component based on their designs.

I have previously done this challenge before, but I decided to start again to test my development.

## My process

I built out the component in HTML first and then changed the styling piece by piece to get the desired look.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS

### What I learned

That I still struggle with handling images, most particularly the sizing of them, overlapping it's containing parent/s.  Where I work right now, this is all set up out of the box on a new build, so I never have to think about it, as well as other things. I need to revisit a lot of stuff, mostly the basics, that these days I don't have to think about.
